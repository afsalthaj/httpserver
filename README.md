## Before I begin 
A quick webserver is built using python to understand how this thing works!

However, I would like to get an excellent clear picture on below fundamentals..
- So was that a webserver which I built now?
- How does this collocate with application server? Not as an example, conceptually.. Is it always browser/client ---> Webserver ---> Application Server?
- Which bit are we building? A web container (tomcat) as part of application server? or a webserver (apache http server)?  Ok how do they differ

Googled, but explanations differ from people to people. Is there a single useful defintion for all of these?

Questions:
- What exactly is a web framework? 
- What's the current state of these two working together? Will I ever end up using a misplaced framework and server? 
- Should my server alwasys implement the server interface of things like WSGI (web server gateway interface) so that any framework can work with my server?
- Whoo... what is a web framework?
